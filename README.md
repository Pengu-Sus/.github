PenguinOS
===========
PenguinOS is based off AOSPA, and is a fork. It is a small project started by AOSPA maintainers, as a fun little project, and to experiment with app design.

It provides some additional features which have been picked from other ROMs/forks, and contains some 
new, custom re-designs done by the PenguinOS team.

It is currently running on Android 14 (udc/uvite).

### Apply for Maintainership

Here are some points to note while applying the official maintainership :-

- Your device sources (device-tree, vendor-tree, kernel-tree, etc.) _must be public._
- You must follow a good commit naming scheme.
- Your trees must indicate you have some sort of experience (not just renaming makefiles).
- As of July 2024, we currently do not have any CI infrastructure. This means you must be capable of building yourself.

### Code review

- As of July 2024, we do not have any code-review infrastructure.
