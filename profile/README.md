PenguinOS
===========
PenguinOS is based off AOSPA, and it is a fork. (Big thanks to AOSPA!)

It is a small, fun, project started by AOSPA maintainers, to learn more about Android development, and to experiment with design.

It provides some additional features which have been picked from other ROMs/forks, and contains some 
new, custom re-designs done by the PenguinOS team.

It is currently running on Android 14 (udc/uvite).
