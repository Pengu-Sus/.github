PenguinOS
===========
- Based on AOSPA (Yeah, we borrowed some cool stuff!)
- It's a fork, so expect random changes (I push updates like it’s my hobby)
- Security patches? Last seen in December 2024
- Features? We pick the best ones from other ROMs and sprinkle in some Penguin magic
- UI? Oh, we redesigned it just because we could
- Performance? It works… most of the time
- Community? No there's no community Budge off
